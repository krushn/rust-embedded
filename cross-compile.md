This issue commonly arises when compiling embedded code targeting non-native platforms (like the RP2040 microcontroller) on macOS, where Mach-O has stricter requirements for section specifiers than other formats (e.g., ELF for Linux).

To resolve this, follow these steps:

### 1. **Ensure You're Targeting the Correct Architecture**
   You need to ensure you're cross-compiling for the correct target architecture, not compiling for macOS. For RP2040, the target is `thumbv6m-none-eabi`. If you haven't already installed this target, you can install it with:

   ```bash
   rustup target add thumbv6m-none-eabi
   ```

### 2. **Check the Linker (Cross-Compilation) Setup**
   You should ensure you're using the correct toolchain for cross-compiling. If you're on macOS, install the `arm-none-eabi` GCC toolchain, which is used for compiling ARM Cortex-M code:

   ```bash
   brew install arm-none-eabi-gcc
   ```

### 3. **Use `.cargo/config.toml` for Cross-Compilation**
   Create or update the `.cargo/config.toml` in your project to specify the cross-compilation target and appropriate linker. Example:

   ```toml
   [target.thumbv6m-none-eabi]
   runner = "probe-rs-cli run --chip RP2040"  # Optional, for flashing to the Pico

   [build]
   target = "thumbv6m-none-eabi"

   [target.thumbv6m-none-eabi]
   linker = "arm-none-eabi-gcc"
   ```

### 4. **Build for the Target Architecture**
   Once everything is set up, try building the project again for the `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target:

   ```bash
   cargo build --target thumbv6m-none-eabi
   ```

### 5. **Disable `rp2040-pac` Section if Necessary**
   If the error persists and is specific to the `rp2040-pac` crate, check for updates to the crate that might fix this Mach-O compatibility issue. If none are available, as a temporary workaround, you can try modifying the crate to avoid the Mach-O section specifier issue.
